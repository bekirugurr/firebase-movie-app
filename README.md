## Description 
<p>In this project, it is aimed to display film details, posters and fragmants by using the tmdb api.  </p>
<p>Anonymous user could enter dashboard page and see movie cards. He/She could not enter detail page thanks to private routing. Only authenticated user can enter detail page. So to enter detail page anonymous user must log in or register.  </p>
<p>There is a search feature according to the entered word. This feature gives movies whose name contains the entered word. But only authenticated user can use this search feature.  </p>
<p>If a movieâ€™s imdb point is greater than or equal to 8, this point is shown with green background color, if it is between 6 and 8 its imdb point is shown with orange background color, if it is under 6  its imdb point is shown with red background color. But imdb point is shown only to authenticated user.  </p>
<p>When mouse cursor goes to a movie card an overview div will emerge that gives a brief info about movie. </p>
<p>Detail page includes movie fragman, poster, release date, imbd point and how many people vote the movie.  </p>
